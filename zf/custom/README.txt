ABOUT THIS FOLDER
=================

This is the only folder that doesn't belong to the Zhong Framework's core. Include here any custom file (css, php, js, image ...) that is not native of Zhong and that you may want to use.
If you want to override the theme's default behaviour or style, access the "overrides" folder and follow the instructions.
